##  Tasks Overview

- **Tasks 1 → 9**:  
  Focus on Python fundamentals, data processing, validation, error handling, performance, and testing.

- **Task 10**:  
  A **mini-project** named **REST-like Log Analyzer**, simulating a real-world backend/security use case.

 Full task descriptions, requirements, and test cases are available in:
- `tasks.txt`
- `Electron_Corp_Python_Internship_Tasks_FULL.pdf`

---

##  Task 10 – Log Analyzer (Important)

Task 10 is a **core evaluation task**.

### You are expected to:
- Parse structured log files
- Aggregate metrics (status codes, IPs, response time, etc.)
- Expose REST-like endpoints (CLI or HTTP)
- Implement filtering & reporting
- Add **unit + integration tests**
- Follow clean architecture principles


---

##  Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

Every task must include:
- Input validation
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios
- At least **5–10 test cases per task**

Task 10 must include:
- Unit tests
- API tests
- Invalid data tests
- Performance-related tests (basic)


---

##  Documentation (MANDATORY)

Inside `necessary_documents_for_this_tasks/` you must provide:

| File | Description |
|----|----|
| `design_notes.md` | Architecture & design decisions |
| `assumptions.md` | Assumptions you made |
| `test_cases.md` | Test cases summary |
| `final_report.md` | What you built, challenges, improvements |

---

##  What We Evaluate

We will evaluate you on:

- Code clarity & readability
- Folder structure compliance
- Problem-solving approach
- Test quality
- Documentation quality
- Ability to follow instructions
- Engineering mindset (not just code)

---


##  Submission Instructions

1. Push your work to a **public GitHub repository**
2. Ensure all tasks are committed
3. Share the repository link with your supervisor

---


##  Final Note

This internship task simulates **real-world engineering expectations**.  
We are more interested in **how you think and structure your solution** than perfect output.

Good luck — and happy coding
